This Project aim is to run several chemicals in batch for neonates (2 weeks and 6 months) and Pregnancy (GW 15 and 24) for an single oral exposure.   
For the chemicals it is only needed the MW, logP, Fu, SMILES and ionization ( pKa nad type ionization). Oral absorption values are as calculate in the internal QSAR. 
There are options to run the different QSPRs for tissue partitioning. 
Currently this code is being produced to be used in a collaboration with INOTIV where they are comparing results with httk and GastroPlus. 
It will be probably be refined for use in ONTOX.
